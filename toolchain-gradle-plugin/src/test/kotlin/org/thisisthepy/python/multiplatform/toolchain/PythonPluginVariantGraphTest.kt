/**
 * The per-variant task graph three other Issue #2 items were all blocked behind.
 *
 * `6a87bdc` closed platform mapping, compile level and Python version by *rejecting* what could not
 * be routed, and recorded one shared reason for stopping there: "`buildTask`/`packageTask` are each
 * one task, not a per-variant graph, so there is nowhere yet to route a validated triple to". That
 * is what [resolveVariants] produces -- the list `PythonPlugin.apply` turns into one
 * `buildPython<Variant>` / `packagePython<Variant>` task pair each, aggregated under the existing
 * `buildPython` / `packagePython` names.
 *
 * ## One task per variant, not one task looping variants
 *
 * Gradle's own convention is the former, and both plugins this DSL imitates follow it: AGP
 * registers `assembleDebug`/`assembleRelease` (plus a lifecycle `assemble` depending on them), and
 * the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin registers `compileKotlinIosArm64`, `linkDebugFrameworkIosArm64`
 * and so on, one per target. Four consequences of that choice are what actually decide it here:
 *
 * 1. **Failure isolation, which Issue #2 asks for by name.** The brief for the compile-level item is
 *    "reject only that variant and let the rest run". A single task looping variants cannot do that
 *    -- the first `resolveBuildLevel` rejection ends the whole task. With one task per variant, the
 *    rejection lands inside that task's action, and `--continue` runs the others.
 * 2. **Up-to-date checking is per task.** One task covering every variant is one up-to-date unit, so
 *    editing one platform's overlay would re-bundle all of them.
 * 3. **Selectability.** `gradle buildPythonAndroidArm64Debug` is how a consumer asks for one variant.
 *    The loop version has no such name, which is exactly why the previous round had to select the
 *    build type with a `-Ppython.buildType` project property instead of a task name.
 * 4. **Distinct outputs.** Each variant bundles to its own directory and zips to its own archive;
 *    Gradle declares outputs per task.
 *
 * ## Naming
 *
 * `<existing task name><PlatformVariant><BuildType>`, e.g. `buildPythonAndroidArm64Debug`. AGP's
 * `assemble<Flavor><BuildType>` and KMP's `compileKotlin<Target>` are both "verb + capitalized
 * dimensions", with the build type last; [PythonVariant.taskSuffix] is the same, and the platform
 * segment is spelled exactly as the KMP target it corresponds to (`androidArm64`,
 * `iosSimulatorArm64`), which is also how the DSL already spells it.
 *
 * ## Why the graph is opt-in
 *
 * [resolveVariants] returns an empty list when `python { }` platform declares nothing, and
 * `PythonPlugin` then leaves `buildPython`/`packagePython` doing exactly what they do today: one
 * host-target bundle, one `<fileName>.zip`. `sample` declares no platforms, so the only
 * chain that currently runs end to end is unaffected by any of this. The platform block is what
 * creates more than one target; without it there is exactly one, and one build type chosen by
 * `-Ppython.buildType` as before.
