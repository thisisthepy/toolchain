/**
 * The step `f60bc3b` named as the next blocker: *"nothing stages the bundle into Android assets,
 * iOS resources or desktop resources."*
 *
 * ## What is being staged, and from where
 *
 * `pypackpack`'s `ResourceBundler` writes `<bundleDir>/python/` plus a sibling
 * `resource-manifest.json`, and its own KDoc states what the first of those is for:
 *
 * > **Payload root is `python/`.** The bundle directory holds a `python/` subdirectory intended to
 * > be placed on `sys.path` verbatim (staged into Android assets, an iOS resource directory, or a
 * > desktop resource folder).
 *
 * So the unit of staging is that directory's *contents*, and the manifest is build metadata that
 * must not travel with it -- staged into a directory that later goes on `sys.path`, a stray
 * `resource-manifest.json` is a file an application can import nothing from and a packager has to
 * ship anyway.
 *
 * ## Why a clean sync rather than a copy
 *
 * The destination is an *input* to somebody else's packaging step -- a JVM resource root, an AGP
 * asset source root. A plain copy never removes what it stopped copying, so a module deleted from
 * the Python package keeps shipping in every APK and jar built on that machine forever. This is not
 * hypothetical for this repository: `python-multiplatform`'s own `copyAndroidPythonAssets` carries a
 * `doFirst { delete(...) }` for exactly this reason, with a comment saying that is how `include/`
 * and `test/` would otherwise have survived being excluded.
 *
 * These tests exercise [stagePythonPayload], the pure function [StagePythonBundleTask] calls from
 * its `@TaskAction`, so the staging rule is pinned without a Gradle `Project` -- the same split
 * `bundleWithPackpack`/`BuildPythonArtifactTask` already uses.
