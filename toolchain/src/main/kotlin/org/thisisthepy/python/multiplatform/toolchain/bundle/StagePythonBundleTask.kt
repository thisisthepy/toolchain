/**
 * Puts a built Python bundle where a platform's own packaging step will pick it up.
 *
 * `f60bc3b` ended with the sentence this task answers: *"nothing stages the bundle into Android
 * assets, iOS resources or desktop resources."* [BuildPythonArtifactTask] produces
 * `<bundleDir>/python/` (plus a `resource-manifest.json`); nothing after it moved that anywhere, so
 * every artifact this plugin's consumers built -- jar, APK, framework -- contained no Python at all
 * even when the bundle on disk was correct.
 *
 * ## This is not the old asset copy
 *
 * `PythonPlugin`'s `afterEvaluate` used to copy `python.localLibraryPath` straight into
 * `src/main/assets/python` by hand, and `f60bc3b` deleted it. Three things differ here and each was
 * a defect there:
 *
 * 1. **The source is a built bundle, not a raw directory.** What is staged has been through
 *    `pypackpack`'s `ResourceBundler`: dependencies resolved, `src/<family>` overlaid on `src/main`,
 *    `__pycache__`/`build`/`dist` excluded, a manifest written. The old copy shipped the developer's
 *    working tree verbatim.
 * 2. **The destination is under `build/`, registered as an extra source root** -- not `src/`. A
 *    generated tree inside `src/main/assets` is checked into git by the next `git add -A`, and is
 *    invisible to `clean`.
 * 3. **The bundle staged is chosen, not assumed.** There is one bundle per
 *    platform-crossed-with-build-type now, and one instance of this task per *destination* -- so
 *    which bundle each destination gets is an explicit, logged decision (`selectStagingVariants`)
 *    rather than "whatever was in the one directory".
 *
 * ## Inputs and outputs
 *
 * [bundleDir] is `@Internal` and [bundlePayload] is the declared `@InputFiles`. That split is not
 * cosmetic and the first version of this task got it wrong: with the bundle declared nowhere,
 * Gradle had no input to compare, reported the task `UP-TO-DATE` on every run after the first, and
 * the staged tree -- and therefore the jar and the APK -- kept a payload from an earlier revision of
 * the Python package. Caught by building the jar, deleting a module, and building again: the module
 * was still in the archive.
 *
 * It is `@InputFiles` over a `FileTree` rather than `@InputDirectory` because the directory does not
 * exist until [BuildPythonArtifactTask] has run, and a missing `@InputDirectory` is a validation
 * failure while a missing file tree is simply empty. There is deliberately **no** `@SkipWhenEmpty`:
 * an empty payload still has to run, because clearing a destination that should now be empty is
 * exactly the case this task exists to handle. (`@SkipWhenEmpty` on a source is also what made
 * `packagePython` silently produce nothing -- see [AssemblePythonPackageTask]'s `init` comment.)
 *
 * [destinationDir] is a real `@OutputDirectory`, so `processResources.from(stageTask)` picks up both
 * the files and the task dependency in one call.

 * `Project`, the same split [bundleWithPackpack] uses -- see `StagePythonBundleTaskTest` for the
 * grounds behind each of the three decisions below.
 *
 * - **Only `python/` travels.** `resource-manifest.json` is build metadata; the staged directory is
 *   meant to go on `sys.path` verbatim (`ResourceBundler`'s own words) and a manifest there is a
 *   file nothing can import and every packager has to ship.
 * - **The payload subtree is deleted first.** A plain copy never removes what it stopped copying,
 *   so a module deleted from the Python package would keep shipping in every APK and jar built on
 *   that machine. `python-multiplatform`'s `copyAndroidPythonAssets` carries a `doFirst { delete }`
 *   for exactly this reason, with a comment recording that this is how excluded directories
 *   survived their own exclusion.
 * - **A bundle with no `python/` root is silence, not failure.** [BuildPythonArtifactTask] `mkdirs`
 *   the bundle and skips `pypackpack` entirely when no `python.localLibraryPath` is configured, so
 *   this is the normal state of a consumer that has not pointed the DSL at a ppp package yet. The
 *   destination is still created, because by then it is already registered as somebody's resource
 *   or asset source root.

/**
 * The three destinations a payload can be staged into, and the mapping from a `pypackpack` target
 * triple onto them.
 *
 * ## What was checked before choosing these
 *
 * `python-multiplatform` was read for the path each runtime actually opens, because a staged
 * location that no runtime reads is decoration. What is there:
 *
 * - **Android**: `PythonBootstrap.stageStdlib` (`androidMain/.../env/PythonBootstrap.kt`) unpacks
 *   `assets/<abi>/lib/python<X.Y>/` into `filesDir` and points `PYTHONHOME` at it. That tree is the
 *   *standard library*, staged by `python-multiplatform`'s own `copyAndroidPythonAssets` task, not
 *   by any consumer.
 * - **Desktop**: `PYTHONHOME` names a python-build-standalone prefix, staged into the Gradle user
 *   home by the bindings plugin's `stagePythonHome` and shared by every project on the machine.
 * - **iOS**: the framework ships no stdlib at all, so `PYTHONHOME` must be set by the host app.
 *
 * **None of those is a path for a consumer's own Python code**, and the library says so in its own
 * source: `PythonProxySource`'s KDoc gives "there is no resource path to put a `.py` on ... getting
 * one generated file into each of those, and onto `sys.path` before the first import, is a
 * per-platform packaging problem this repository has not solved for anything" as its reason for
 * rendering Python as a Kotlin string instead of shipping a file.
 *
 * So the receiving contract does not exist yet, and the only written one is the *producing* side's:
 * `ResourceBundler`'s "payload root is `python/` ... intended to be placed on `sys.path` verbatim
 * (staged into Android assets, an iOS resource directory, or a desktop resource folder)". That
 * sentence names these three destinations, and [PAYLOAD_ROOT][PythonStagingLayout.PAYLOAD_ROOT] is
 * the name it gives them. What remains after this task is a runtime that puts the staged directory
 * on `sys.path` -- which is `python-multiplatform`'s side of the boundary, not this plugin's.
 *
 * ## Why the family comes from `ppp` and not from the DSL name
 *
 * `Platforms.getPlatformFamily` is the same function `ResourceBundler` uses to decide which
 * `src/<family>` overlay a bundle gets, so classifying by it means the staged payload and the
 * destination it is staged into cannot disagree about what platform they are for. Deriving it from
 * the DSL variant spelling instead would be a second classifier able to drift from the first.
